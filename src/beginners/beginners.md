# Beginners

Here is the guide for complete beginners on how to solve the Rubik's cube using the Roux Method.

Make sure to read the [notation](./beginners/notation.md) page if you don't know any notation, but even if you're not too confident with them, the interactive cube can still be very helpful.

## Cube Pieces

Each 3x3 cube has `3` distinct cube types:

1. Corner pieces
   - There are `8` corner pieces on each cube, and each corner piece has `3` different colours on them.
2. Edge pieces
    - There are `12` edge pieces on each cube, with each edge piece having `2` different colours on them.
3. Centers
    - There are `6` centers on each cube, with each center consisting of just `1` colour.`
    - No matter how much you mess the cube up, the *orientation* of the centers remains identical â€” white opposite yellow, blue opposite green, and red opposite orange
