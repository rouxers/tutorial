# Introduction

Welcome to the world of Roux! This method is a good option to go to as both a beginner and as someone switching from another method such as CFOP.

This tutorial will be split into two parts, the first being a completely beginner oriented approach, and the second being for more intermediate solvers with knowledge of how the cube works.

Even if you don't end up switching to Roux, the cubing knowledge that you get from it can still help improve your speed with other methods - they don't become sunk costs.
